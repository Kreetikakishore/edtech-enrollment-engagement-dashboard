## 📌 Executive Summary

Online education platforms generate large volumes of learner interaction data, but converting this raw data into actionable enrollment strategy requires structured analytics.

This project analyzes **10,000 learner enrollments** across demographic groups, course categories, pricing models, and skill levels to uncover:

- Who the most active learners are
- What courses drive the highest engagement
- When enrollment peaks occur
- Where strategic opportunities exist to improve learner retention and paid course adoption

The final output is an interactive **Streamlit business dashboard** built for decision-makers to monitor learner participation and optimize platform growth.

## 🎯 Business Questions Addressed

- Which learner age segment contributes the highest enrollment volume?
- Are users more inclined toward free courses or paid programs?
- Which course categories generate the strongest engagement?
- How balanced is participation across gender groups?
- Which skill level attracts the largest learner base?
- Are there identifiable monthly enrollment spikes?
- What strategic actions can improve conversion from casual learners to repeat users?

### 2. Free Courses Act as Primary Acquisition Funnel
More than **64% of all enrollments are concentrated in free courses**, revealing strong price sensitivity and highlighting free offerings as a top-of-funnel learner acquisition strategy.

### 3. Data Science Leads Overall Course Demand
Among all categories, **Data Science records the highest enrollment count**, suggesting sustained demand for career-oriented technical upskilling.

### 4. Beginner-Level Programs Drive Highest Participation
The majority of users prefer beginner-friendly content, indicating that a large percentage of learners are entering new learning domains rather than pursuing advanced specialization.

### 5. June Shows Strong Seasonal Enrollment Spike
Enrollment volume peaks sharply in June, signaling a recurring opportunity for targeted promotional campaigns and certification pushes.
